\section{Method}
\label{method}

\todo[inline]{Rewrite this section based on what we actually did.}
\todo[inline]{Separate into subsections: Object Detection, OCR, etc.}

Aligning with the discussion of previous works in
section~\ref{previous-solutions}, we will use
a method based on \ac{yolo}(\cite{redmon2016look}) for the task of object
detection, in a similar vein as \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1909-01754}. 

We propose a two-phase method for \ac{alpr}. First, we will train a \ac{NN} to
recognize license plates on an image. Then, we feed the recognized \ac{LP} to
a second \ac{NN}, trained for the task of \ac{OCR} of \ac{LP}s.

\subsection{Implementation}
We plan to implement both \ac{NN} components with PyTorch (\cite{pytorch}).
For cutting out the \ac{LP} from the image, we will use the OpenCV library
(\cite{opencv}).

For data, we will rely on existing benchmark datasets for the most part (e.g.
\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/GoncalvesSMS16}). We focus on Hungarian \ac{LP}s, but
will probably have to resort to the use of internation datasets.
