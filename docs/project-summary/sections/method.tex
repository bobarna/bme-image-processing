\section{Method}
\label{method}

In this section we discuss the different methods used in our solution.
We deconstruct the task of license plate recognition into arbitrary smaller parts.
The first great challenge of license plate recognition is determining the location of the plate in the picture.
In an upcoming subsection we will introduce the used bounding box detection system.
The other major challenge of license plate recognition is actually reading the plate.
After we have assigned a bounding box the rest is up to an \ac{OCR} subsystem.
An \ac{OCR} recognises characters printed on the plate.
