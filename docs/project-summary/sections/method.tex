\section{Method}
\label{method}
In this section we discuss the different methods used in our solution.  We
deconstruct the task of license plate recognition into arbitrary smaller parts.
The first great challenge of license plate recognition is determining the
location of the plate in the picture.  In an upcoming subsection we will
introduce the used bounding box detection system.  The other major challenge of
license plate recognition is actually reading the plate.  After we have assigned
a bounding box the rest is up to an \ac{OCR} subsystem.  An \ac{OCR} recognizes
characters printed on the plate.

\subsection{YOLO Object Detection}
We used transfer learning to train a YOLOv7 based on the original implementation
of the paper by \cite{yolov7}. We detect a single object on each image: license
plates. We trained our model for $100$ epochs. We achieved around $90\%$
precision on both training, data and validation data, which carried over to
images of Hungarian license plates as well.

Although the goal of the project is the detect Hungarian license plates, we
observed that a model trained on international license plates generalizes well
enough for the object detection problem. This also made us easier to find
datasets online, as our Hungarian license plate dataset did not include bounding
box data. (See our code repository
\footnote{\url{https://github.com/bobarna/bme-image-processing}} for more
details on the datasets used.)

We used a test data set not seen during training for verifying the model's
generalization capabilities after training. Performance on a randomly sampled
subset of these test images can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:yolo-test-eval}.

These results show that the model detects the license plates in almost all
cases. Although we can see that the model usually gave a high confidence to the
right detection, while further (usually incorrect) detections have been given
a lower confidence value, we intentionally kept the confidence threshold low in
order not to miss harder to see license plates, even when some other object got
incorrectly recognized with a higher confidence.
