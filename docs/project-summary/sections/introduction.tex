\section{Introduction}

There are many use cases e.g. in traffic control, where the \ac{LP} of vehicles
must be read.  This task can be automated by computers. A wall-mounted or even
hand-held camera can take pictures of cars. The image then can be processed by
various algorithms to detect the \ac{LP}, segment the characters and finally
recognize these characters.  In recent years with the increasing amount of
traffic, the need for well-performing \ac{ALPR} systems has increased
substantially.

After a discussion of the current state-of-the-art, we propose our own \ac{ALPR}
implementation, evaluating it in multiple visual scenarios.

Our implementation is available at
\url{https://github.com/bobarna/bme-image-processing}, with detailed,
reproducible steps for all stages of our pipeline.
