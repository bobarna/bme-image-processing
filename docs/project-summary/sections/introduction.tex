\section{Introduction}

There are many use cases in traffic control, where the \ac{LP} of vehicles must
be read.  This task can be automated by computers. A wall-mounted or even
hand-held camera can take pictures of cars. The image then can be processed by
various algorithms to detect the \ac{LP}, segment the characters and finally
recognize these characters.  In recent years with the increasing amount of
traffic, the need for well-performing \ac{ALPR} systems has increased
substantially.

We propose our own \ac{ALPR} implementation.  We write about the
state-of-the-art literature of the field. Our solution will be based on some of
these publications. Our goal when selecting from the many available methods was
to select the methods with the most promising test results.

We provide a project outline describing our planned tasks. The development
process can be split up into a few large portions. This is visualized on a Gantt
chart, where you can review each subtask.

After successful implementation, we will test our work on predefined training
data as well as further real-life data. We also list some evaluation
considerations.

Our implementation is available at

reproducible steps.
