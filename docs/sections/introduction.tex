% Introduce the problem, and the purpose of this proposal.

There are many use cases in traffic control, where the license plate of vehicles must be read. 
This task can be automated by computers. A wall-mounted or even hand-held camera can take pictures of cars.
The image is processed by various algorithms to detect the license plate, segment the characters on the plate and finally recognise these characters.
With the increasing amount of traffic the need for well performing \ac{alpr} systems in recent years has increased substantially.

We propose our own \ac{alpr} implementation.
In this proposal we write about the state of the art literature of the field.
Our solution will be based on some of these publications.
We provide a project outline describing our tasks in detail.

After successful implementation we will test our work on the training data and real-world data.
For this purpose we introduce some evaluation methods.
