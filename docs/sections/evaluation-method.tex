Propose the evaluation metrics, and the possibility of using real life data
later on.

There is a huge number of variables, which can effect the effectivity of the program for example:
the distance of the vehicle, the wheather and lighting strength. The plan is to make difficulty categories, with the combination
of these parameters. With these categories we can test the programs effectiveness categorised by difficulties.
